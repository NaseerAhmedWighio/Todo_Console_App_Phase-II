## Response snapshot

Continued working with the existing Todo App Phase II specification at specs/002-todo-app-web/spec.md. The specification is comprehensive and covers the transformation from console app to full-stack web application with authentication, database, and UI components. Created a quality checklist at specs/002-todo-app-web/checklists/requirements.md to validate the specification completeness. The spec includes:

- Executive summary with purpose, vision, and scope
- Functional requirements for user management, task management, and data isolation
- Non-functional requirements for performance, security, usability, and availability
- System architecture with technology stack and component diagram
- User interface requirements with design system and interaction design
- API specification with authentication requirements and endpoints
- Quality assurance requirements
- Deployment and operations guidelines
- Acceptance criteria with functional, non-functional, and security aspects

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Validated existing Todo App Phase II specification for completeness
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for specification validation
- 📁 Files: 2 files reviewed/created including spec and checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with /sp.plan for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification is comprehensive and ready for planning phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
